## TL;DR:
* `FixedUpate` and `Update` are similar but perform in different ways

* Use `FixedUpdate` instead of `Update` when making physics-based calculations
* Adding a force happens per frame, which varies from computer to computer, and even within the same computer. To account for this, use `Time.deltaTime`, which is the amount of time since the last frame. So it can speed it up / slow it down appropriately.
* Creating a variable in a script then adding that script to an object makes you able to populate the variable within Unity. From there, you can populate it with something like RigidBody by dragging and dropping, which allows you to access that variable from within the code. (You basically create the variable, populate it with the object in Unity, then you can manipulate it.)

## Brackeys Unity Episode 3 - Movement
* `Input.GetKey()` good at first, but not great for smoothening input or supporting alternative keys / controllers.
* Smoothening is important for stuff like jumping, even though it's fine for simple movements.
* Better solution: check for input in `Update` method, store in a bool (or other var). If true, move. Otherwise, don't.
