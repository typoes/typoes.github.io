## TL;DR:
* CORS is implemented by the browser.
* The pre-flight request basically asks the server if we're even allowed to make a call.

## In tech:
Notes from [CORS : Understanding Cross Origin Resource Sharing](https://www.arbazsiddiqui.me/cors-understanding-cross-origin-resource-sharing/?ck_subscriber_id=558045541)

* SOP (Same Origin Policy) restricts cross origin access. CORS circumvents that. Both are implemented by browsers.
* Two types:
    * Simple requests. Main criteria:
        * API method is `GET`, `POST`, or `HEAD`
        * `Content-Type` header is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, `text/plain`
    * Preflight Requests
        * Most common is b/c `Content-Type` is `application/json`)

* Pre-flight request is made with `OPTIONS` method. Contains all info of actual request.
* Server replies to pre-flight with all CORS headers, so browser will know whether it can go ahead and make a call

### Flow Summary
1) Here's what I'm going to send
2) Server responds with allowed data
3) Browser interprets response and decides
whether or not to make call

### Longer Version

1) "I'm going to make a call with GET method, Content-Type  header, and Accept  header, from https://test.com origin"

```
curl --location --request OPTIONS 'http://example.com/status' \
--header 'Access-Control-Request-Method: GET' \
--header 'Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type, Accept' \
--header 'Origin: http://test.com'
```

2) Server responds
```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Accept
```



3) Browser interprets this and checks if call can be made. Because in this case `*` is origin, the browser will make the call. If it had something like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://domain.com`, would have encountered `Cross-Origin Request Blocked error`.
