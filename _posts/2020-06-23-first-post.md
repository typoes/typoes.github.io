## TL;DR:
* Set-up is time consuming
* Zettelkasten exists
* Sublime shows all files, Bear doesn't. Switch?
* Change work spaces for better focus

## In tech:
* Setting something new up is a pain in the butt no matter how simple.
    * Took a bit to get a new template. While not difficult, it was time-consuming, plus "hidden costs" of allowing my machine to [handle multiple GitHub accounts at once](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/manage-multiple-github-accounts-the-ssh-way-2dadc30ccaca/).

* Rediscovered the Zettelkasten note-taking system when trying to find a way to use Sublime text for note-taking. Sublime is lightweight and makes it easy to search all your existing text with a fast click. Plus all your existing files are easily visible. While organized, Bear's lack of instant visibility is more of a problem than I expected.

## In personal
* Moving throughout the day makes the day feel longer. Jumped from desk to outside to dining table and felt focus improve.
