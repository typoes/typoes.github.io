## TL;DR:
* Use ngrok for tunnels to localhost
* Use python to create http server

## In tech:
* ngrok makes it super easy to create tunnels to localhost
* But what about when you're just seeing files locally? How do you set up a server?
** In the directory you're trying to create a server for, run `python3 -m http.server`
** BOOM!
