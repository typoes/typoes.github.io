## Values
Remember them as Computer Generated PRIDE.

* Connection
* Gratitude
* Positivity
* Reflection
* Initiative
* Discipline
* Enthusiasm


## Goals
* Preserve strong connection to *family* with consistent, bi-weekly check-ins with each of them
* Break routine with a new activity once per quarter with *friends*
* Create *education* game for teaching a language
* Obtain a *black belt* in a martial art
* Develop a consistent 2nd source of revenue
* Maintain strong *mental health* through meditation and up-keeping a good environment
* Pass the Level 1 Japanese *Language* Proficiency Test

## Reminders
- Make time every quarter to reflect on progress towards goals
- Create action items when weaknesses are identified. Put them on the pin board as a daily reminder.

### Connection
* To job
* To what I'm actively doing (mindfulness)
** (To protect against mindless activity)
* To family
* To friends
* To hobbies
* To goals

### Gratitude
* To self and the progress I've made
* To family
** Voice it. No regrets.
* To friends
** Openly and clearly.
** Normalize it. Make it part of my friendship culture.
* To those who have helped me
** Even if not a priority, reach out occasionally. Let others know the impact they had.
** Teachers
** Acquaintances
** Friends who aren't as close
** Friends who are farther away
** Friends who have drifted away

### Positivity
* Optimism is not the same as positivity. Move away from negative language tendencies and self-deprecating humor
* Uplift self and others
* Use reflection to identify negative language habits
* Realize this doesn't mean hide or remove negative feelings, but to channel them in a more positive way (e.g. _share_ challenges as opposed to complaining about them)
* Work on not ranting excessively about those that cause frustrations
* "I hate X person" vs "It frustrates me when X does Y"
** Even if the word hate is used loosely, it gives off the wrong impression. And because language shapes thought, it might amplify negative feelings towards X

### Reflection
* On each of these values to ensure progress
* To ensure fulfillment
* To ensure progress
* To reinforce growth
* To log and _see_ progress -- otherwise faulty memory doesn't allow me to fully see and appreciate patterns or changes

### Initiative
* To fulfill the cliche of "be the friend you want to have"
** Not just to "be there" for someone, but actively seek people out and lead relationships by example
* To be aware of thoughts like "I wish ..." and take the initiative to fulfill them
** e.g. I wish I didn't have to set the env variables every time
*** So make a PR
** I wish someone would check up on me every so often
*** So check up on someone every so often
* At work. Stop waiting for others to lead around. Be the leader your ego tells you you are but are too lazy to be


### Discipline
* In the workplace
* To connections made with friends and family
* In working towards finding enthusiasm
* In overcoming inertia to make steady progress towards goals
** 10 min a week towards a goal is better than nothing
** Maintain steady movement (even if slow) towards goals
** In making "difficult" choices in the moment when motivation is lacking

### Enthusiasm
* Displayable -- because I really feel it
* With friends and with family
** Finding new activities
** Connecting more clearly and enthusiastically
*** e.g. don't contact someone for the sake of contacting them. Tell a story, share something interesting, call them to _hear_ their reaction as you send them a funny image
* With job
** If can't find any enthusiasm, have to change mental approach, the actual work you're doing, or even change jobs. It could be as simple as changing environments to keep work more interesting
